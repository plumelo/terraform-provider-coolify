# Terraform Provider for [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) _v4_

Documentation: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/SierraJC/coolify/latest/docs

The Coolify provider enables Terraform to manage [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) _v4 (beta)_ resources.
See the [examples](examples/) directory for usage examples.

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). As the current version is 0.x.x, the API should be considered unstable and subject to breaking changes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin using the Coolify Terraform Provider, ensure you have completed the following steps:

1. Install Terraform by following the official [HashiCorp documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install).
1. Create a new API token with _Root Access_ in the Coolify dashboard. See the [Coolify API documentation](https://coolify.io/docs/api-reference/authorization#generate)
1. Set the `COOLIFY_TOKEN` environment variable to your API token. For example, add the following line to your `.bashrc` file:
   ```bash
   export COOLIFY_TOKEN="Your API token"
   ```
